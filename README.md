# Workflow Automation
This repository contains modules to automate some development tasks as well as provide utilities to increase efficiency. Descriptions of each modules are provided in the sections below.
All modules have executable scripts that are available through the `panda` runner for convienience.

## Panda Runner

The panda runner provides a convienient way to run any script in this repository by
running `panda <command>`.

In order to enable auto-completion for available commands place the following line in your .bashrc file.

`source /usr/local/automation/bin/.command-completion`


## inspection_diff_scope
Commands: `panda diffscope`

This command uses `git diff` to create a custom scope in Webstorm.
The scope contains only changes between the current branch and a desired comparison branch, usually `develop`.

After generating the scope with this command, navigate to Webstorm's code inspection and select `custom scope` -> `inspectionDiff`.
Note that the scope generated by the diffscope command will always be named `inspectionDiff`.

### Troubleshooting

__ERROR: Failed to add scope, ScopeManager doesn't exist__

If Webstorm doesnt have any defined scopes, the script doesnt know where to add a new scope. To fix, create a new scope in webstorm and run the script again.
